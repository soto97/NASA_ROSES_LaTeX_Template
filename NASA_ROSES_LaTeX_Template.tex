%% Needed for fonts in xelatex to work
%%%
% NOTE: I actually use XeLaTeX, which allows me to get the fonts 
% exactly the way that I want them. For proposals, this means
% I can use Times New Roman instead of the default Computer
% Modern. I actually like Computer Modern, but since Times New
% Roman is standard, there's no point in throwing off a reviewer
% with an unexpected font, particularly one with such a 
% polarizing reaction in readers. New upset the reviewrers, I 
% always say.
%
% What's the point of this bit of rambling? If you do not want to use
% XeLaTeX and would rather stick to good old LaTeX, then you
% need to comment out the next few lines of font packages and
% font commands.
%
% If you want to use XeLaTeX but want different fonts, then you
% just need to change the name in the argument for \setmainfont
% and \setsansfont. Make sure that the font you use is loaded on
% your machine and your TeX distribution knows how to find it.
% See Google if you need to learn more about this.

\section{Biographical Sketches}
From Section 2.3.7 of NASA's \emph{Guidebook for Proposers}, the Biographical Sketches  section is described as: ``The PI (and Co-PI) must include a biographical sketch (not to exceed two pages) that includes his/her professional experiences and positions and a bibliography of recent publications, especially those relevant to the proposed investigation. A one-page sketch for each Co-Investigator must also be included (Note: Any Co-I also serving in one of the three special Co-I categories defined in Section 1.4.2 may use the same two-page limit as for the PI). For the PI and any Co-Is who are required to provide Current and Pending Support information (ref. Section 2.3.8), the biographical sketch must include a description of scientific, technical and management performance on relevant prior research efforts. Those participants who will play critical management or technical roles in the proposed investigation should demonstrate that their qualifications, capabilities, and experience are appropriate to provide confidence that the proposed objectives will be achieved.''

\section{Table of Personnel and Work Effort}
Summary of work effort: This is a new fifth section of the proposal. [Note, location differs from and supersedes that given in Guidebook. [Clarified May 12, 2015]

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.1cm,itemindent=0.3cm,labelwidth=\itemindent,labelsep=0cm,align=left]
\item[\textbf{General: }] Note this table has been moved from the budget Section. \item[\textbf{Required: }] Where names are not known, include the position, such as postdoctoral fellow or technician.
\item[\textbf{Required: }] Names and/or titles of all personnel to perform the proposed effort
\item[\textbf{Required: }] Planned work commitment (e.g., in fractions of a work year) to be funded by NASA
\item[\textbf{Required: }] Planned work commitment (e.g., in fractions of a work year) that will not be funded by NASA, if any. Note: time commitment included here that is not funded by NASA is not considered cost sharing, as defined in 2 CFR § 215.23.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Current and Pending}
From Section 2.3.8 of NASA's \emph{Guidebook for Proposers}, the Current and Pending  section is described as: ``Information must be provided for all ongoing and pending projects and proposals that involve the proposing PI. This information is also required for any Co-Is who are proposed to perform a significant share (>10 percent) of the proposed work.''

\section{Statements of Commitment and Letters of Support}
\emph{If necessary.}
\newline
\newline
From Section 2.3.9 of NASA's \emph{Guidebook for Proposers}, the Commitment and Support section is described as: 
\begin{quote}
``Every Co-PI, Co-I, and Collaborator (ref. definitions in Section 1.4.2) identified as a participant on the proposal's cover page and/or in the proposal's Scientific/Technical/ Management Section must acknowledge his/her intended participation in the proposed effort.''

``The NSPIRES proposal management system allows for participants named on the Proposal Cover Page to acknowledge electronically a statement of commitment. Although we prefer all team members to confirm participation via NSPIRES, if that is not possible the inclusion of a statement of commitment in the proposal as set out in the example below may be permitted instead.''
